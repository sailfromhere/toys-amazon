    It does look exactly like the one in the picture HOWEVER, it isn't an official Rainbow Loom - just a cheap copy.  The loom itself is quite roughly made and would probably snag the loom bands when you take the bracelet off.  Also, the hook is plastic and will probably snap in time.  The official Rainbow Loom kit has a much smoother and superior made loom and the hook is metal so will last.  It does however, cost twice as much as this kit but well worth it I think.  I merely bought this kit for the plastic storage box and extra loom bands as the Rainbow Loom kit comes in a cardboard box.  Hope this helps.

    I put my pool on the grass on top of a ground sheet to protect it. I personally wouldn't put it directly onto a hard standing without any padding or protection for the pool but more importantly it will be quite dangerous for children or adults if put directly onto a hard standing.

    Yes - it tips from the front backwards - we have to rip up lots of paper for him to place in the bins to tip in the back then turn the compactor wheel to tip all over the floor again to start all over again.  My grandson who is 2 yrs absolutely adores his garbage truck as he calls it and takes it everywhere with him - the only thing is the wheelie bin handles that clip on the back can be a little bit fragile - I have looked to find replacement wheelie bins because he only has one left but they are £10.00 for 3 which I think is a little bit extortionate.  Although my grandson is only two I think any child up to the age of 5 yrs will have hours of fun with this.

    It is a model kit which means you have to assemble it from numerous parts and glue it together. Then it has to be painted, something which several builder take very seriously and try to create a life like worn look with rust etc. When finished most of the fun is gone and the model will be placed on the shelf. It is not supposed to go in the water, it will not float straight or even at the right waterline. Eventually it will flood and sink.

If you want something to start a collection from, understanding you will need to buy more cards before being able to create any serious decks then this is slightly better than the fat pack.

    Short answer is yes :) But only if playing each other from the pack. It comes with many cards and lots to test and play with. It is what I use it for as you can do 40 card decks if you want mono colours or for doubles do 40 or 60 card decks. However, the set comes with two cards at max of any card unless you are lucky. Thus, when playing with others whom collect you will loose as any deck made from this set is very luck based. Especially when they have four of some cards in their deck. I love just mixing cards and testing small strategies with this deck and it does add some good core cards to any collection. Hope this helps.

    I never actually saw this kit which was forwarded direct to my young nephew. However, I do know that the kit was boxed and that was what was delivered, a box/chest. I would be very surprised it the kit contained a large table. When I placed my order I took it for granted that my nephew's mother would have to provide a level playing surface. This could be a table or it could just as easily be a floor. Because it is a kit of parts, the finished track need look nothing like the Amazon illustration which was provided merely as a guide as to what was possible. Think of the product as 'Meccano' in wood. What results depends upon the imagination of the user.

    Yes. We thought the balls were the 'cells' that our son was talking about but there is a hexagonal shaped piece which slides over the top of the cell blaster - apparently this is the 'cell'. If you push the end of the cell blaster onto the villain vault and twist, the cell drops into the vault. There is only one cell with the kit though so it could be a problem if it gets lost.

    Hi Sarah,  I think it is meant to be left standing as you have to loosen the allan key screws to flatten the frame - I suspect this is to prevent the kids from flattening it and getting their fingers trapped.  When the fittings are tightened, the stand is very robust and secure.  Having said that, we now have to rotate toys due to lack of space, and the market stand does pack away easily.  The top just lifts off and rolls up, the slats just lift off the shelves and, using the allen key to loosen the fittings, the main frame does collapse.  So in answer to your question, if you keep the allen key close by and don't mind loosening and re-tightening it, then yes.  However, the stand looks so gorgeous with the crates of fruit and veg on it it is a shame not to have it on display.  Thanks,Cathy

    Each jump has a number on it which is the dice roll to clear it. If a six is rolled you get one of the event cards (cleared/faults/not cleared etc). So, you set up the fences as you want them (using the 'jump numbers') on one side of the board (arena or cross-country) and each player has a horse and a 'spooked' card. Each player then gets a turn (youngest first). Using the timer to start: one rolls the dice over and over trying to get the number of that jump, and then onto the next. If you run out of time it's 4 faults extra (not a problem in our experience). If you get three 'refusal game cards' then you're out of the round. At any time, any player can use their spooked card and 'spook' i.e. make the rider repeat the previous jump. Once you've all had a go, a rosette is awarded, the board turned over and you all go again for the second round. Then you award a rosette for round 2 and a cup for the overall winner based on total points....and then you clean up the tweenager blood. (it's a horse thing that girls do). Good Luck.

If one of you throws an Aaahh, then you throw again and if it's another Aaahh, you lose that round. The first player to win all 3 cupcakes wins the game. If one player has two cupcakes and the other has one cupcake, you have to keep playing rounds until you can take the third cupcake from the other player.
